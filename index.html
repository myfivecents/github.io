        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <p>My path to becoming a software developer began while I was still attending The Ohio State University. Before graduating,
            I realized that becoming a dietitian was not what I really wanted to do. So I started looking around at other
            options, and quickly became interested in biostatistics. I signed up for an entry level course and loved being
            able to use data to solve problems. Wanting to continue my education outside of the academic setting, I began
            utilizing online courses to teach myself R, even trying to incorporate it in my job working fo Children's Hunger
            Alliance, a non-profit in Columbus, Ohio. </p>

        <p>I quickly realized that I needed more instruction in programming in general if I was going to continue my learing,
            so I switched to more general computer science courses and realized this is what I wanted to do for a career.
            I started devoting all my free time to learning as much as I could, but realized I needed a more immersive experience.
            I enrolled in
            <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/" target="_blank">Tech&nbsp;Elevator</a> to gain this experience, continue my education, and receive the guidance needed to be
            successful in a new field.</p>

        <h2>My goals</h2>

        <p>Upon graduating, I plan to begin a career as a junior developer. I am looking for a role that will allow me to continue
            to learn, while applying my recently gained knowledge on the job.</p>
