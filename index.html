        <h2>My Story</h2>

        <p>My path to becoming a software developer began while I was still attending The Ohio State University. Before graduating, I realized that becoming a dietitian was not what I really wnated to do. So I started looking around at other options, and quickly became interested in biostatistics. I signed up for an entry level course and loved being able to use data to solve problems. Wanting to continue my education outside of the academic setting, I began utilizing online courses to teach myself R, even trying to incorporate it in my job working fo Children's Hunger Alliance, a non-profit in Columbus, Ohio. </p>

        <p>I quickly realized that I needed more instruction in programming in general if I was going to continue my learing, so I switched to more general computer science courses and realized this is what I wanted to do for a career. I started devoting all my free time to learning as much as I could, but realized I needed a more immersive experience. I enrolled in <a href="https://www.techelevator.com/" target = "_blank">Tech Elevator</a> to gain this experience, continue my education, and receive the guidance needed to be successful in a new field.</p>
